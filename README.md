Spotifest is a project that I have created in my spare time combining my passion for music and coding. The goal for the application is to allow users to upload a festival lineup and the application will create a playlist for you based on the artists going to the festival.

## Current Stages

Currently users can use the application to log into their spotify accounts, browse their playlists and playmusic from them. Users can also search for artists and add them to their unique playlist. The user can then view this playlist in wither artist or song layout and then create a playlist with their desired selections.
