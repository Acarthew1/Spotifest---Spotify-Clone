# What is the Spotifest

DEPLOYED TO
https://spotifest-944cc.firebaseapp.com/

Spotifest is a project that I have created in my spare time combining my passion for music and coding. The goal for the application is to allow users to upload a festival lineup and the application will create a playlist for you based on the artists going to the festival.

## Current Stages

Currently I have created a Spotify Clone allowing users to see all of their playlists, and play the songs within them.

## Future stages

I am currently working on the artists page which will display information about the selected artist as well as an option to add them to your festival playlist
